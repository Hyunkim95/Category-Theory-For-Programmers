# Category Theory For Programmers
Solutions to exercises in Bartoz Milewski's *Category Theory for Programmers* which can be found [here](http://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/). There is currently a Swift playground version for the solutions, and hopefully sometime soon a purely markdown version as well.
